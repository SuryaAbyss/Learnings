# Computer Network - *CN*

### Introduction to Networks vs. Computer Networks

- **Network**: A system that carries a commodity or information between two or more entities.
   - Examples: Transportation networks, postal systems, telephone networks.
- **Computer Network**: A system that carries information between two or more entities in the form of electric signals.

### Analogies Between Transportation and Computer Networks

- **Vehicles/People** ↔ **Packets/Payload**
- **Street address** ↔ **IP address**
- **Intersection** ↔ **Bridge/router**
- **Traffic jam** ↔ **Network congestion**
- **Stop and go traffic light** ↔ **Flow control**
- **Taking alternative path** ↔ **Alternative route**
- **Accident** ↔ **Collision of packets**
- **Following a route to destination** ↔ **Routing algorithm**

### Why Study Computer Networks?

- **Potential Benefits**:
   - Good-paying jobs in network administration, programming, or research.
   - Increasing usage in daily life and business.
- **Usage Examples**:
   - **User Level**:
      - Email, web browsing, social networks, video-on-demand, online banking/shopping, online gaming.
   - **Business Level**:
      - Accessibility of data, programs, and equipment irrespective of physical location.
      - E-commerce companies like Amazon, eBay, Flipkart.
   - **Futuristic Usage**:
      - Sensor networks for environmental monitoring, health monitoring, interplanetary internet.

### Impact of Computer Networks (As of 2010)

- 2 billion Internet users.
- 294 billion emails sent per day.
- 255 million websites.
- 2 billion videos watched per day on YouTube.
- 600 million Facebook users.
- (As of 2013) 1 billion YouTube users (15% of Earth's population).

#### Job Opportunities in Networking

- **Deployment, Maintenance, and Debugging**:
   - Network administrators, network technicians, field engineers, network analysts.
- **Design and Development**:
   - Network programmers, research scientists, professors.

### Benefits of Networking

- Connectivity and communication.
- Data sharing and hardware sharing.
- Internet access.
- Data security and management.
- Performance enhancement.
- Entertainment.

### Disadvantages of Networking

- Hardware, software, and setup costs.
- Management costs for hardware and software.
- Undesirable sharing.
- Data security concerns.

### Requirements for Computer Communication

- **Hardware**:
   - **Communication End Points**: Servers, desktops, laptops, smartphones, etc.
   - **Network Interface Card**: Hardware that connects a device to a network.
   - **Communication Links**: Physical media interconnecting computing devices (e.g., co-axial cable, fiber optics, twisted-pair, wireless).
   - **Switches/Routers**: Interconnect networks made up of hosts and links.
- **Software**:
   - **Protocol**: Defines the format and rules for exchanging messages.
      - What to send (Format).
      - When to send and how to act (Rules).
   - **Example of Protocol Interaction**:
      - Human protocol vs. computer network protocol (e.g., "Hi", "Hi", "Got the time?", "2:00").
      - TCP connection request and response for web pages.
