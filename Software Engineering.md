# Software Engineering

### **What is Software Engineering?**

- **Definition:** A systematic collection of good program development practices and techniques.
- **IEEE Definition:** The application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software.
- **Components:**
   - **Software:** Collection of executable code, associated libraries, and documentation.
   - **Engineering:** Development using well-defined, scientific principles and methods.

### **Programs vs. Software Products**

- **Programs:** Typically small, single user, developed by one person, lacks proper documentation and user interface.
- **Software Products:** Larger, multi-user, team-developed, well-documented, with a proper interface.

### **Evolution of Software Engineering**

- **1950s:** Assembly language programming, exploratory programming.
- **1960s:** High-level languages (FORTRAN, ALGOL, COBOL), structured programming (avoiding GOTO statements).
- **1970s:** Data structure-oriented design (Jackson's Structured Programming).
- **Late 1970s:** Data flow-oriented design.
- **1980s:** Object-oriented design, focusing on identifying objects and their relationships.

### **Key Concepts in Software Engineering**

- **Abstraction:** Simplifying complex problems by focusing on relevant details.
- **Decomposition:** Breaking down a complex problem into smaller, manageable components.

### **Need for Software Engineering**

- **Complexity Management:** Larger software requires systematic engineering approaches to manage complexity.
- **Scalability:** Engineering principles are needed to scale software efficiently.
- **Cost Management:** Proper processes reduce development costs.
- **Dynamic Nature:** Adaptation to changing requirements and environments.
- **Quality Management:** Ensures the production of quality software products.

### **Software Crisis**

- **Issues:** Software failing to meet user requirements, frequent crashes, high costs, maintenance difficulties, late delivery, and inefficient resource use.
- **Contributing Factors:** Larger problems, lack of adequate training, increasing skill shortage, and low productivity improvements.

### **Characteristics of Good Software**

- **Operational:** Budget-friendly, usable, efficient, correct, functional, dependable, secure.
- **Transitional:** Portability, interoperability, reusability, adaptability.
- **Maintenance:** Modularity, maintainability, flexibility, scalability.

### **Computer Systems Engineering**

- **Involves:** Developing both software and hardware, integrating them, and conducting final system testing.
- **Key Focus:** Deciding which tasks are solved by software and which by hardware.

### **Differences Between Exploratory and Modern Software Development**

- **Exploratory Style:** Focused on error correction, coding synonymous with development, ad hoc documentation.
- **Modern Style:** Emphasizes error prevention, systematic processes, thorough documentation, use of life cycle models, better planning and project management.

### **Software Life Cycle and Models**

- **Life Cycle:** Series of identifiable stages (feasibility study, requirements analysis, design, coding, testing, maintenance).
- **Life Cycle Models:** Provide a structured approach to development. Important models include:
   - **Classical Waterfall Model**
   - **Iterative Waterfall Model**
   - **Evolutionary Model**
   - **Prototyping Model**
   - **Spiral Model**

### **Importance of Life Cycle Models**

- **Benefits:** Ensures systematic and disciplined development, easier project management, accurate progress tracking, and avoiding the "99% complete" syndrome.

### **Summary**

- **Software Engineering:** A systematic collection of programming experiences and innovations.
- **Necessity:** Adoption of a life cycle model is crucial for developing large software products systematically and efficiently.
